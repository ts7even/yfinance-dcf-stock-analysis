B) EV/EBITDA multiple. Find the EV/EBITDA multiple and comapre it with the market and future growth, historical growth.

we are only going to focus on industries that have high growth potential, and industries that are going to last in the future. For an example,

C) Short-Term Evaluation... Hedge opportunist aspect. Whatever means necessary if an opportunity rises, we will take with shorts, puts, hositle takeovers, junkbonds ect.
